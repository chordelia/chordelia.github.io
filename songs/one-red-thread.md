# "One Red Thread" by Blind Pilot

Capo: 2nd Fret

[Intro]

Em Esus4

[Verse]  
oh from the first that the line got drawn  
it was poison in the land it was on  
one red thread through the middle of a song  
my only one, my only one  

C G / C G / Em G / C - / Em Esus4 Em Esus4 Em Esus4 Em


I can't remember the age that i was  
but not that story that pumped in my blood  
when you were the savior  
and I was the taker of oh where i was  


[Chorus]  
oh but man oh man you can do what you want  
oh man oh man you can do what you want  
the only line that is true is the line you're from  

C G / C G / D C / Em Esus4 Em Esus4 Em Esus4 Em

[Verse]
I have to say there was a mile or two  
I had the itch to fly and i flew  
now at best we would make our dreams  
with something used with something used  

and from the minute that the line got drawn  
I couldn't see straight to you for nothing  
now me, I'm the poison in one  
yah I'm the one I am the...  


[Chorus]

[Chorus]
