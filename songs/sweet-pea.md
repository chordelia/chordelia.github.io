Sweet pea  
Apple of my eye  
Don't know when and I don't know why  
You're the only reason I keep on coming home

Sweet pea  
What's all this about  
Don't get your way all you do is fuss and pout  
You're the only reason I keep on coming home  
  
[Bridge]  
I like the Rock of Gibraltar. I always seem to falter  
And the words just get in the way  
Oh I know I'm gonna crumble. I'm trying to stay humble  
But I never think before I see  
  
E7 - / Am - / D - / G -  
  
Sweet pea  
Keeper of my soul  
I know sometimes I'm out of control  
You're the only reason I keep on coming  
You're the only reason I keep on coming yeah  
You're the only reason I keep on coming home  
  
C - / E7 - / Am - D - / CAm FG /  /  / C
