[Intro]  
G Am C G x2  
  
[Verse]  
Twenty-five years and my life is still  
Trying to get up that great big hill  
Of hope for a destination  
  
G / Am / C / G  
  
I realized quickly when I knew I should  
That the world was made of this brotherhood  
Of man, for whatever that means  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed  
Just to get it all out, what's in my head    
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar  
  
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside  
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and  
I scream at the top of my lungs "What's going on?"  
  
[Chorus]  
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"  
I said "Hey, what's going on?"  
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"  
I said "Hey, what's going on?"  
  
[Interlude]  
Ooh, Ooh Ooh  
Ooh, Ooh Ooh  
G Am C G / /   
  
[Verse]  
And I try, oh my God do I try  
I try all the time, in this institution  
And I pray, oh my god do I pray  
I pray every single day  
For a revolution  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Interlude]  
  
[Outro]  
Twenty-five years and my life is still  
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope  
For a destination
